# Data

This folder includes the data distribution used for my experiment:
* [mnist_clients_distribution.json](/data/mnist_clients_distribution.json) is an example of distribution on 10 clients file used for the MNIST_loader class. To build this the indices of train data are split on each client (25% of client indices are the validation) and the test data is used to test the model.
* [arma_clients_distribution.csv](/data/arma_clients_distribution.csv) is the multivariate time series distribution, on 10 clients, used for  the Time_series_loader. To build this distribution, 5 Arma series are generated by another program, each client takes 2000 time steps and the rest are taken for the test data.

### Notes

* To use the MNIST clients distribution refer the path of the json file in the config at the key name "distribution", else a new distribution will be generated.

* To use the Arma clients distribution refer the path of the csv file in the config at the key name "data" and change the value of "distribution" key as true, else a new distribution will be generated.
